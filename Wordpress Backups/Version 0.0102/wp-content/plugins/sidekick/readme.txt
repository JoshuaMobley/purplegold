**SIDEKICK is the fastest and easiest way to learn WordPress, Themes & Plugins!**

Sidekick provides interactive, real-time, narrated guides through the WordPress administration area. These guides (called Walkthroughs) come in three flavours:

- **Overviews**: Guided tours through admin screens and their features.
- **How-Tos**: Step-by-step instructions to help you complete a task.
- **Hotspots**: Useful reminders for on-screen elements, features and functions.

**Walkthroughs for other plugins and themes? You bet!**

If you're running a plugin or theme that’s supported by Sidekick, we’ll automatically serve up those Walkthroughs, as long as the Walkthroughs are active for your Sidekick account.

**A modern browser is all you need.**

Sidekick is built with JavaScript, so you don’t need to download any additional browser extensions or add-ons. Just install the SIDEKICK plugin for WordPress.

**SIDEKICK is perfect for you, if...**

*You're new to WordPress.* Instead of jumping back-and-forth between documentation, videos, and your own WordPress site, just follow the step-by-step SIDEKICK walkthroughs. Simple!

*You're helping someone learn WordPress.* Instead of repeatedly showing them the basics, let SIDEKICK do it for you - just install the plugin and tell them which walkthroughs to follow.

*You build WordPress sites for a living.* Reduce your training and support costs by installing Sidekick on client websites.

**Powered by the SIDEKICK platform.**

WordPress is just the tip of the iceberg! Sidekick can work with any web application, requiring no app or browser extension downloads for the user.

Walkthroughs are served directly from our servers, so you don't need to download or install additional files as new or updated walkthroughs are released.

With the user’s permission, Sidekick will collect anonymous data to track walkthrough and platform performance. This helps us improve the product and provide more useful support.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Sidekick for WordPress? =

The Sidekick platform provides real-time, guided support and learning from within any html or PHP based web application or CMS. Support is provided through modules called “Walkthroughs” that guide users through everything from understanding simple aspects of an application to completing complicated tasks.

The Sidekick plugin for WordPress connects the Sidekick platform with any WordPress Dashboard allowing real-time guided walkthroughs of core and 3rd party WordPress features and functions.

If you’d like to learn more about Sidekick, go to [Sidekick.pro](http://Sidekick.pro/ "Sidekick")

= What is a Sidekick Walkthrough? =

A Sidekick for WordPress Walkthrough is a real-time, guided tutorial that walks you step by step through completing a task inside your WordPress Dashboard. It’s as if your site-builder or theme developer were standing right there with you, helping you get it done.

= What are Core and 3rd Party WordPress Walkthroughs? =

When we say “Core Walkthroughs” for WordPress, we are referring to any support and learning that has to do with features and functions provided by a fresh, default install of WordPress, downloaded from WordPress.org. Basically, if a walkthrough is helpng you complete a standard WordPress function like creating a post, it’s a Core Walkthrough and SIDEKICK created it.

Plugin and theme specific Walkthroughs are called Third Party Walkthroughs and are created and maintained by the plugin or theme creator, unless otherwise mentioned.

= How do I create Walkthroughs for my Plugin(s) or Theme(s)? =

At the moment Sidekick Composer, the tool we use to create Walkthroughs, is for in-house use only but we plan for that to change by the end of July 2014. If you’re interested in getting a head start, fill out the form [on this page](http://www.sidekick.pro/developer-program/) and we will send you details on how to join us a little earlier.

= What does Sidekick for WordPress cost? =

The Sidekick plugin for WordPress is and always will be free to download and use. Installing the plugin gives you instant and unlimited access to 30 Core WordPress How-To and Overview Walkthroughs.

If you would like access to the full library of [Core WordPress Walkthroughs (Over 150)](http://www.sidekick.pro/wordpress/modules/wordpress-core-module-premium/) including Hotspots, the cost is $10 a month per URL.

= Ok, the plugin is installed and activated. How do I use it? =

Click on the “Help Me” bottom left of your screen to open the Walkthrough menu.
You will be presented with the Walkthrough menu. Select your bucket then your walkthrough and away you go.

= Can I suggest a Walkthrough that I’d like to see or give you feedback on the Sidekick WordPress Plugin? =

Absolutely. In fact, we rely on users like you  to tell us about things that need to be improved or that you’d like to see added to the plugin. Send your email to info@wpuniversity.com. We read and respond to every piece of feedback we get.
